The aim of this project is to create a framework code for an animated train following curves.

The project extensively utilizes three.js as its javascript graphics library and dat.GUI as its GUI. The images / objects folders contain online free assets and the copyrights are reserved to the original producers.

The js folder contains code written by Wei-Ting Chen 2018.
